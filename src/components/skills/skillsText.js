        text: `I am very familiar with the React framework and hooks. Connecting react with with a 3rd party API, or one I’ve developed is my bread and butter. I enjoy the swiftness of React's virtual DOM, making dynamic components and subsequently feeding them data from APIs for dynamic content. My favorite aspect of React is it’s state management and context hooks which allow for a streamlined system of passing variables between different dynamic components. `,

Using express is like a super power when it comes to setting up a server. It’s easy for me to take the skeleton of an old express server and apply and expand functionality for a new application.  ',

        text: 'When it comes to using this non-relational database I feel very comfortable storing and feeding data from Mongo.  Generally I work with Mongo through the mongoose module in Node.js, mongoose has a clean syntax, and it’s easy to apply hooks to tailor made schemas fitting any database need. Mongo is great because it scales, once a Database is initiated it doesn’t require a lot of extra code to handle an expanding user base. ',

        text: 'It is easy to pick up a new library module and add functionality to an existing API. I’ve used puppeteer and cheerio for scraping old data and migrating the data to a new domain. While working with node I’ve frequently had to use a new module and apply it within an existing application. I have worked with everything from axios to simplify fetch requests, to using google maps API for loading a custom map with custom markers. Working with node allows for the migration of repeatable tasks to easy to use methods. Using node modules allows me to use extra functionality while keeping my codebase a manageable size. The built in methods in node modules also tend to keep the codebase less abstract and enhance readablity for projects with a larger team of developers. ',

    title: 'communication',
    text: 'Throughout my eight year career in the United States Air Force I was continuously honing my communication skills. The military is a conglomeration of diverse culture and brings forth people from all different walks of life. Because of the diversity in the Air Force, I had to ensure I could effectively and concisely communicate with anyone I worked with. I frequently had to facilitate meetings which passed information from leadership down and vise versa. During these meetings I mediated leadership and subordinate concerns in a manner that lead to more cohesive unit, and subsequently more effective mission execution. I also frequently had to draft new Enterprise-Level guides for the Air Bases I was stationed at, these guides allowed for a standardized process across the whole Air Base. This experience pairs great with software development and the AGILE methodology. ',

My experience in working with many teams over the years makes it easy to adapt to a new team and work environment.  ',

  {title: 'adaptability',
  text: 'My career in the Air Force forced me to adapt, both in my personal and professional life. Whether it was moving to a different unit due to a Permanent Change of Assignment, moving to a completely different Air Base due to a Permanent Change of Station, or deploying to a different country for six months; there was always a need to adapt. During my moves I had to quickly shift gears to fit the units’ mission. Different units used different tools such as Content Management Systems (CMS) and I had to quickly become efficient using these tools. When I finally became adept in a process I was moved to a new area and had to adopt a totally different perspective and methodology. Dealing with these adversities made me very comfortable adopting new practices and tools, which has really helped me in my software development journey. ',
